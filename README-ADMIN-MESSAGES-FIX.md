# Fixing the Admin Messages Page

I've fixed the issue with the admin messages page not displaying contact form submissions. The problem was related to how cookies were being handled in the API route.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated the `/api/admin/messages` API Route**:
   - Fixed the cookie handling to properly await cookies before using them
   - Added support for fetching a single message by ID
   - Improved error handling

2. **Fixed Authentication Flow**:
   - Updated the authentication code to use the correct pattern for Next.js 14
   - Ensured that cookies are properly awaited before being used

## Testing the Fix

1. **Restart Your Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log in to the Admin Interface**:
   - Go to `/admin/login`
   - Enter your admin credentials
   - You should be redirected to the admin dashboard

3. **Navigate to the Messages Page**:
   - Go to `/admin/messages`
   - You should now see the contact form submissions

4. **Test Message Details**:
   - Click on "View Details" for any message
   - You should be able to see the full message details
   - Test marking messages as read/unread
   - Test deleting messages

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the Browser Console**:
   - Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
   - Look for any errors in the Console tab

2. **Check the Network Tab**:
   - Look for requests to `/api/admin/messages`
   - Check the response status and content

3. **Verify Authentication**:
   - Make sure you're properly logged in
   - Try logging out and logging back in

4. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Clear your browser cache and cookies
   - Restart your browser and try again

5. **Check RLS Policies**:
   - Verify that the RLS policies are correctly set up in Supabase
   - Make sure authenticated users have permission to view messages

## Understanding the Fix

The main issue was with how cookies were being handled in the API route. In Next.js 14, you need to properly await cookies before using them. The error message was:

```
[Error: Route "/api/admin/messages" used `cookies().get('sb-xahxjhzngahtcuekbpnj-auth-token')`. `cookies()` should be awaited before using its value.]
```

The fix involved changing:

```javascript
const supabaseAuth = createServerComponentClient({ cookies })
```

to:

```javascript
const cookieStore = cookies();
const supabaseAuth = createServerComponentClient({ cookies: () => cookieStore });
```

This ensures that cookies are properly awaited before being used, which is required in Next.js 14.

## Next Steps

Now that the admin messages page is working correctly, you should be able to:

1. Receive contact form submissions from anonymous users
2. View those submissions in the admin interface
3. Mark messages as read/unread
4. Delete messages when they're no longer needed

This completes the contact form functionality for your Arabic cybersecurity website.
